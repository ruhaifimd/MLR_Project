# Multiple Logistic Regression Project

This repository contains the files and analyses for an assignment on **Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR)** as part of the [Multivariable Analysis, Doctor of Public Health Program]. 

## Objective
The aim of this assignment is to:
- Explore the association between multiple independent variables and a binary outcome.
- Apply MLR to develop predictive models and interpret results in the context of real-world data.
- Gain hands-on experience with statistical modeling techniques in R.

## Contents
- **Data**: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- **Scripts**: R scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Reports**: Final report summarizing the methods, results, and interpretation.
- **Presentation**: Slides summarizing key findings and methodology.

## Tools

- **GitHub**: Collaboration and version control.
- **R Libraries**: 
  - `tidyverse` for data manipulation.
  - `ggplot2` for visualization.
  - `car` and `MASS` for statistical modeling.
